The purpose of this software is to provide teachers with a comprehensive tool for efficiently managing courses and student information. By centralizing key aspects such as class details, syllabus, individual class dates, tests, student names, enrollment IDs, grades, and attendance records, this software streamlines administrative tasks and enhances the overall teaching experience. 

The initial idea is to create an intuitive interfaces and robust features. The aim is to empower educators to organize their teaching materials, track student progress, and facilitate effective communication within the classroom environment. Ultimately, this software seeks to optimize teaching workflows, improve student engagement, and promote academic success.

This is a personal project I'm making for a friend who is a teacher.

The app won't be web based.

Initially this project will use only Python and SQLite.
